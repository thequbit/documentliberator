Document Liberation Tool Set

### About

There are all kinds of different types of documents out there.  Some of which
are rather difficult to work with.  Not only are the difficult to work with
but sometimes they are very difficult to find.

Document Liberator is a tool set intended to be used to find, convert, and index
documents on the web.  Documents can be found automatically by using web scrapers,
or manually uploaded by users.

Document Liberator's number one goal is to make working with digital documents
as easy as possible for individuals and teams of all technical levels.
